# Weather and Air Quality Web App

## Description

This Weather and Air Quality Web App is a class project developed during my computer science major at Florida International University (FIU). It leverages Streamlit and the AirVisual API to provide real-time weather and air quality data based on various search criteria, including city, state, country, nearest city (IP-based), or specific latitude and longitude coordinates.

## Features

- Real-time weather and air quality data from AirVisual API.
- Search options by city, state, country, nearest city (IP Address), or latitude and longitude.
- Interactive map visualizations using Folium.
- Displays key data such as temperature, humidity, and air quality index.

## Installation

To set up and run this project:

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/carlosbernal2222/weatherApp.git

2. Install required Python packages:

pip install streamlit pandas requests streamlit_folium folium

3. Run the Streamlit application:

## Usage

After installation, access the web app via a browser. Select the desired search method to view weather and air quality data, presented alongside an interactive map.
